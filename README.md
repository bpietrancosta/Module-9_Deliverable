## Weather Analysis between the months of June and December
### Our data set is a list of daily temperatures. We were able to produce summary statistics about these temperatures during June and December. Below are the 3 primary points of analyses we were able to define:
### - The temperature count for June is 1700 while for December it's 1517. See screenshot below for the ordered screenshot evidence:

December has 31 days and June has 30 days which means that there are issues with record keeping. This is worth noting as evidence of bad record keeping could mean 
further issues with the data. The effect is to reduce our confidence in the data set.

- The mean temperature for June is slightly higher (~74) than December (~71). We can refer to the same screenshots for evidence. This is an interesting observation as most places, regardless display greater differences in temperature between mid-year and end of year.

- The data distribution seems to match between the June and December months. The primary outlier is the minimum temperature during each month. The standard deviation between the months of June and December is very similar, 3.7 and 3.3 respectively. With the exception of the minimal temperature the summary statistics for June and December are within 4 degree Fahrenheit of each other. This shows that the data 
is very similar during both months.

## In conclusion, this is fairly typical as you would generally expect a greater temperature variance between June and December. But makes for a revealing analysis.
